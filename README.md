### What is Worderize
A work order is a task or job that can be scheduled and assigned to someone who wants to get this job. Worderize is a platform in which customers can create and workers can get the work orders. Worderize brings customers and workers together to manage work orders in an easy way. 

Registered workers can select a "worder" from filtered work orders list according to their job type and location preferences. Later on, they can change these preferences with updating their profiles.

The whole process can be monitored by customers so they can track their work orders via application. They can create multiple work orders and manage each of them.
